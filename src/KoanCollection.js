    "does a dog have Buddha-nature?"
    Joshu replied, "無!"`

    "title": `Joshu’s Bowl`,

    "text": `A monk said to Joshu, 
    "I have just arrived at this monastery. I beg you, please teach me." 
    Joshu asked, "Have you eaten your porridge?"
    The monk replied, "I have." 
    Joshu responded, "Then go and wash your bowl."
    At that moment the monk was enlightened.`

    "title": `Joshu Visits the Hermit`,

    "text": `Joshu went to visit a hermit and asked,
    “How are you? What’s going on?”
    The hermit lifted up his fist.
    Joshu said, “The water is too shallow to anchor here,”
    and went away.
    A few days later, Joshu visited the hermit once again and asked how he was doing.
    The hermit raised his fist again.
    This time Joshu said,
    “Well given, well taken, well killed, well saved.”
    And he bowed to the hermit.`

    "title": `Nansen Kills the Cat`,

    "text": `Nansen saw the monks from two different halls of the monastery fighting over a kitten.
    He seized it from the group and said,
    “If any of you can say a single word of Zen right now,
    I will spare this cat’s life. Otherwise I will kill it.”
    No one had a response. So Nansen cut the cat in half.
    That evening, when Joshu returned, Nansen told him what happened.
    Joshu took off his sandals, placed them on his head, and walked away.
    Nansen said,
    “If only you had been there, you could have saved the cat.”`

    "title": `Nansen’s Ordinary Mind`,

    "text": `Joshu asked Nansen, “What is The Way?”
    Nansen answered, “Your ordinary mind — that is The Way.”
    Joshu asked, “Can it be understood?”
    Nansed replied,
    “The more you pursue it, the more it slips away.”
    Joshu asked,
    “How can you know that it is The Way?”
    Nansen responded,
    “The Way does not belong to knowledge,
    nor does it belong to non-knowledge.
    Knowledge is illusion.
    Non-knowledge is beyond comprehension.
    When you get to The Way without doubt,
    you are as free as the vastness of space,
    an unfathomable void;
    so how could you explain it with a yes-or-no?”
    Upon hearing this, Joshu was awakened.`

      "title": `Joshu’s Zen`,

      "text": `A monk asked Joshu,
      “If I don’t have anything on my mind, what should I do?”
      Joshu answered,
      “Throw it out.”
      “But if I don’t have anything,” replied the student,
      “how would I throw it out?”
      “Well then,” said Joshu, “carry it out.”`

      "title": `The Real Way is Not Difficult`,

      "text": `Joshu addressed an assembly of monks:
      “The Real Way is not difficult, but it dislikes The Relative.
      All speech is concerned with either The Relative or The Absolute.
      This old monk is not within The Absolute.
      What do you think about that?”
      A monk said,
      “If you are not within The Absolute, how can you judge its value?”
      Joshu replied, “I don’t know.”
      “But Master Joshu,” argued the monk,
      “if you don’t know, then how can you say that you are not within The Absolute?""
      Joshu responded, “Great question. Let’s finish up now and leave.”`
